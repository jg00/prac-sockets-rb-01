<!-- Somewhere in this cdn, io is injected into the global scope (ie into the window).  You can check by opening basic.html file directly and run console.log(window.io)).  
     We need io for the second script. 

     In this example just using cdn here instead of setting up express server (making route to '/' and res.sendfile(_dirname + '/index.html') ie serve
     index.html page with snippet <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>) and having socketio server serve it (socket.io-client) up. 

     Side note - In socketio's getting started page they show an example on how to serve and load the socket.io-client, 
     which exposes a io global (and the endpoint GET /socket.io/socket.io.js), and then connect.

<script>
  const socket = io("http://localhost:8000"); // returns a socket object;  JUST THIS ALONE triggers the io.on("connection", cb) on the server to execute.
  // let ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000"); // Create a WebSocket Object.

  console.log("SOCKET OBJECT RETURNED INITIALLY", socket);
  // console.log(ws); // WebScoket{url:..}

  /*
    For code below:
    1 As soon as we connection is established above, the socket.on listener below will fire (ie socket.on('connect', data),
    2 on the server io.on("connection", (sockety, req)=>{..}) hears the connect and callback is executed. An event called 'welcome' is triggered to send data back to client using socket.emit("welcome", "Welcome to the websocket server!").  "welcome" is arbitrary event name given.
    3 On the client the cb for the "connect" is called where the socket is listening for a specific event called 'welcome'.
  */

  // ws.onopen = event => {  // NOTE .onopen is replaced with .on("connect").  So when the connection is open the server's io.on("connection", (socket,req)=>{..}) will here this and fire it's cb.
  socket.on("connect", data => {
    console.log("DATA:", data); // undefined

    socket.on("welcome", message => {
      console.log("MESSAGE:", message);
    });

    socket.emit("message", {
      data: "I am so excited I am connected! It is like Christmas!"

  /*
    // Reference only for WebSockets with notes
    let ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000"); // Create a WebSocket Object.
    console.log(ws); // WebScoket{url:..}

    As soon as a connection is open we send a message via our WebSocket connection object
    ws.onopen = event => {
      ws.send("I am so excited I am connected! It is like Christmas!");
    };

    onmessage is an event listener to be called when a message is 'received' from the server.
    ws.onmessage = event => {
      console.log(event);
    };
